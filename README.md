# Conv1D
Detecting a triple zero (000) side by side using machine learning algorithms
My project is about a machine learning program which detects if there is a “TripleZero” (000) side by side in a given array of string which can have a max 250 length. I have used Python and: 1. numpy, tensorflow, keras libraries to train my program;  2. matplotlib to take the learning rate graphics from various trials.  I will show them later in my report. My sequential model  contains below algorithms and functions: 1. Conv1d, 2. Maxpooling1D, 3. Flatten, 4. Dense blocks, 5. ReLU and sigmoid activation functions, 6. Binary cross entropy to calculate loss function and  7. Stochastic gradient descent algorithm for optimizing and updating the kernels and weights.  I have run my code on google colaboratory which is a free environment with many Python and deep learning libraries available, offering us a GPU (Nvidia Tesla K80 GPU) computing environment for developing deep learning applications.
●It is a sensitive network for frequencies, 
● It provides learning according to the data frequency in the source, 
● It can be used for audio files, 
● This applies well to the analysis of time sequences of sensor data (such as gyroscope or accelerometer data).  
● It also applies to the analysis of any kind of signal data over a fixed-length period (such as audio signals).  
● Another application is NLP (although here LSTM networks are more promising since the proximity of words might not always be a good indicator for a trainable pattern).
